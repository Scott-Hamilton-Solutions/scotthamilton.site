# scotthamilton.site

Today is April 12, 2025, Saturday.

Another newly created repository. This on is for an experimental website, teesting features and keeping an on going journal of this coding journey. 
According to GitHub I alone can choose who commits changes to this repository.

I'm really hoping the it is secure enough. 

Either way, yes this is all experimental. I'm learning, so I experiment.

Thanks, for staying. Not much to see here at this moment anyway.

Scott Hamilton.
